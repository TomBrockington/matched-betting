        <p>You really want to check out BetFair and there are almost no real exchanges so im happy to use a real example. This is a site where you can accept lay bets from other players around the country. Where they would make a bet with you for one horse to win and your conditions to win would be any horse but that one winning. You need the money to cover your bets here. So depost Â£500 just to be safe</p>
